a)
With Little's result, using $N_{min}$ as the minimum number of simultaneous
listeners, $\lambda_{min}$ as the minimum request intensity and $T$ the length of a
song, then
$$N_{min} = \lambda_{min} T \Leftrightarrow \lambda_{min} = \dfrac{N_{min}}{T} =
5/3\ \text{requests\ per\ minute,\ or}$$
$$\lambda_{min} = \dfrac{5\cdot 24 \cdot 60}{3} = 2400\ \text{requests\ per\ day}$$


b)
With Little's result, using $N$ as the number of people in the exhibition, $T$
the average duration of their visit and $\lambda$ the rate at which the tickets
to exhibition are made available
$$N = \lambda T \Leftrightarrow \lambda = \dfrac{N}{T} = \dfrac{250}{40}\
\text{available\ tickets\ per\ minute,\ or}$$
$$\lambda = \dfrac{250 \cdot 60}{40} = 375\ \text{available\ tickets\ per\ hour}$$
