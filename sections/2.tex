For the missing pieces of the diagonal of the state transition intensity matrix,
the following equation holds:
$$q_{i,i} = -q_i = -\sum_{i \neq j} q_{i,j}$$

Hence matrix $Q$ is formed as

\begin{equation*}
  Q =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -2  & 1   & 0   & 1   \\
    1   & -4  & 3   & 0   \\
    0   & 3   & -3  & 0   \\
    0   & 3   & 0   & -3  \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

Given a state $s$ that can transition to states $\{s_i\}$, the time the
system spends in state $s$ is an exponentially distributed random variable
$T = min(\{s_i\})$, which means that its parameter will be
$\lambda = \sum \lambda_{s \rightarrow s_i}$, and the mean time the system
spends in $s$ will be $\overline{T} = \frac{1}{\lambda}$.

Ergo, $\overline{T}_1 = \frac{1}{1+1} = 0.5$ sec,
$\overline{T}_2 = \frac{1}{1+3} = 0.25$ sec,
$\overline{T}_3 = \frac{1}{3} = 0.33$ sec, and
$\overline{T}_4 = \frac{1}{3} = 0.33$ sec.

The length of the packets transmitted and received is exponentially
distributed, and as the intensity of the transition from state $4$ to state $2$
denotes, with parameter $3$, $l \sim Exp(3)$.


In steady state $[\pi_1\ \pi_2\ \pi_3\ \pi_4] \cdot \mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{0}$,
where $\pi_i$ is the probability of the radio being in state $i$. Solving the
system of equations gives
$$[\pi_1\ \pi_2\ \pi_3\ \pi_4] = [\frac{3}{16}\ \frac{3}{8}\ \frac{3}{8}\ \frac{1}{16}]$$

Hence there is a probability of $\frac{3}{16}=18.75\%$ that the radio is in
stand-by, $\frac{3}{8}=37.5\%$ that the radio is listening to the radio channel
for incoming packets, or receiving a packet, and $\frac{1}{16} = 6.25\%$ that
the radio is transmitting a packet.
